# Gadget-Store-Website
Welcome to the **Gadgets Store**! This is an online store built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and a little bit of **JavaScript**. The goal of this project is to provide users with a sleek and easy-to-use interface where they can browse and buy the latest gadgets.

## Project Features:

### 1. **Responsive Design**
   The store is designed to be fully responsive, meaning it looks great on desktops, tablets, and mobile phones. You can easily navigate through the store no matter what device you are using.

### 2. **Product Categories**
   We offer a variety of products including:
   - **Watches**
   - **Mobiles**
   - **PCs & Laptops**
   You can filter products based on these categories using the filter buttons on the homepage.

### 3. **Shopping Cart**
   The store has a simple cart system:
   - You can add products to your cart by clicking the cart icon on each item.
   - The cart will display the number of items and the total price.
   - You can place an order directly from the cart page (though the order system here is only for front-end interaction).

### 4. **Product Listing**
   All products are listed with their images, titles, and prices. Each item has a "cart" icon that you can click to add that item to your shopping cart.

### 5. **Simple Navigation**
   The website features a simple navigation system, making it easy to explore the products. You can:
   - View the homepage.
   - Explore different categories of products.
   - Add items to your cart.

### 6. **Interactive Features**
   - The cart can be opened and closed by clicking the cart icon or the close button.
   - The product categories change based on the button you click (e.g., showing only "Watches" when you click the "Watches" button).

## Technology Used:
- **HTML**: Used to create the structure of the webpage.
- **CSS**: Used for styling and making the page visually appealing.
- **JavaScript**: Used to handle the cart functionality and interactivity.
- **Ionicons**: Used for cart and close icons.

2. **Open the files**: Simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view the store.
3. **Browse and Shop**: Explore the gadgets and add items to your cart. You can filter by category or view all products at once.

## Future Enhancements:
